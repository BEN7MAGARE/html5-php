# HTML5-PHP

This is a **highly experimental** fork of the html5lib PHP parser.

The need for an HTML5 parser in PHP is clear. This project extends on
the work of a previous (but seemingly abandoned) PHP parser. Beginning
with the [original source](https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/checkout), we have
create a newer version and are working to add the following features:

- An HTML5 serializer [in progress; early alpha]
- Support for PHP namespace [done]
- Composer support [in progress]
- Interoperability with QueryPath [not started]
- Add non-HTML namespace support to parser.

## Thanks to...

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the original authors of html5lib.
